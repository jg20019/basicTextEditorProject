      But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can
      not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
      here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The
      world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can
      never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be
      dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus
      far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the
      great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take
      increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure
      of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have
      died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
      freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people,
      shall not perish from the earth.
